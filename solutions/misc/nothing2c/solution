I provided the source code for this challenge in this directory to show exactly what's happening when you run this program.

If you try to run the program normally, it will simply print to standard output:
`LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL`

However, the output of the program contains a special character called "Carriage return".
It is a non-printable control character that commands a printer/output system to move the position of the cursor to the first position on the same line.
Text printed after the carriage return is going to overwrite text that was printed before the carriage return.

If we decide to redirect the output of the program into a file like so:
`./nothing2c > out`

and we cat out the ENTIRE contents of out:
`cat -A out`

we will the entirety of the output, which will contain the flag, the carriage return char, and the string of LOLs
