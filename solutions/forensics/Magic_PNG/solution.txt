This challenge is a classic case of path traversal vulnerability.

We see that our input is not being checked or sanitized, and is being passed straight into opening a file.
So since we want to grab the flag.txt file which is in the vault directory outside the directory the server is running in,
we need a relative path to flag.txt. We can do this using ..

In Linux and Windows, "./.."  points to the parent directory of the current directory in every single directory in the filesystem.

in order to escape the artworks directory, we provide an input that starts with `../`
Then we can nagivate to the vault: `../vault/`
and then try to get the flag: `../vault/flag`

This should give us the flag!
